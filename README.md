  <h1>Interactive Geospatial Analysis with Jupyter Notebook and geemap</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the repository for interactive geospatial analysis using Jupyter Notebook and geemap!</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files showcasing the power of geospatial analysis using Python and the geemap library. With geemap, you can visualize and analyze geospatial data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) directly within the Jupyter Notebook environment.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive Mapping</strong>: Create interactive maps with layers of geospatial data.</li>
    <li><strong>Earth Observation Analysis</strong>: Access and analyze satellite imagery and other Earth observation data.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Data Processing</strong>: Perform spatial analysis, such as calculating statistics, extracting features, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Visualization</strong>: Generate custom visualizations of geospatial data using matplotlib, folium, and other Python libraries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>To get started, simply clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook files in your preferred environment. Make sure to install the necessary dependencies, including geemap and its dependencies, to run the code successfully.</p>
